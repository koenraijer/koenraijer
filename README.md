### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a medicine student who dabbles in web development and data science. Currently building websites for charity at https://studio.koenraijer.io/

More specifically, I'm learning SvelteKit, and through it, full-stack web development (in the modern serverless sense of the word). I intend to learn using Firebase and as I'm still trying to finish CS50, I might use that, or something based on WebAssembly for my final project.
